}
```

## Error Handling

The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages in case of issues:

- **401 Unauthorized:**  
  When the API key is missing or invalid.
  
  ```json
  { "error": "Invalid API key" }
  ```

- **400 Bad Request:**  
  When the required parameter (`orgName`) is missing.
  
  ```json
  { "error": "Missing organization name (orgName)." }
  ```

- **500 Internal Server Error:**  
  For any unexpected server errors or issues with the GitHub GraphQL API.

---

## Notes

- The API uses a GitHub GraphQL client initialized with a token from the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.
- The `api_key` header is validated against the value set in `SERVER_API_KEY`.
- The API returns both organization-level and repository-level projects.
- Projects are returned in an array, with each project containing metadata about its source and status.

Happy coding!
